Creates a File object for the specied path name. The path name may be a
 directory or a le.
Creates a File object for the child under the directory parent. The child may be
 a le name or a subdirectory.
Creates a File object for the child under the directory parent. The parent is a
File object. In the preceding constructor, the parent is a string.
Returns true if the le or the directory represented by the File object exists.
Returns true if the le represented by the File object exists and can be read.
Returns true if the le represented by the File object exists and can be written.
Returns true if the File object represents a directory.
Returns true if the File object represents a le.
Returns true if the File object is created using an absolute path name.
Returns true if the le represented in the File object is hidden. The exact
 denition of hidden is system dependent. On Windows, you can mark a le
 hidden in the File Properties dialog box. On Unix systems, a le is hidden if
 its name begins with a period (.) character.
Returns the complete absolute le or directory name represented by the File
 object.
Returns the same as getAbsolutePath() except that it removes redundant
 names, such as "." and ". .", from the path name, resolves symbolic links (on
 Unix), and converts drive letters to standard uppercase (on Windows).
Returns the last name of the complete directory and le name represented by
 the File object. For example, new File("c:\\book\\test.dat").getName() returns
test.dat.
Returns the complete directory and le name represented by the File object.
For example, new File("c:\\book\\test.dat").getPath() returns c:\book\test.dat.
Returns the complete parent directory of the current directory or the le
 represented by the File object. For example, new
File("c:\\book\\test.dat").getParent() returns c:\book.
Returns the time that the le was last modied.
Returns the size of the le, or 0 if it does not exist or if it is a directory.
Returns the les under the directory for a directory File object.
Deletes the le or directory represented by this File object. The method returns
 true if the deletion succeeds.
Renames the le or directory represented by this File object to the specied name
 represented in dest. The method returns true if the operation succeeds.
Creates a directory represented in this File object. Returns true if the the directory is
 created successfully.
Same as mkdir() except that it creates directory along with its parent directories if
 the parent directories do not exist.
